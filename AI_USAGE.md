# AI Usage Notes

I used AI tools to speed up design and development. Summary:

- ChatGPT: Generated the initial project scaffold, TypeScript hooks for exponential backoff and AbortController logic, and a downscale helper using canvas. Also helped draft README and AI_USAGE files.
- GitHub Copilot: Assisted with small code completion during component wiring and CSS classes.
- Local testing: I used Playwright example tests generated with AI prompts (then modified locally).

All AI-generated content was reviewed and adapted manually for correctness and accessibility.
